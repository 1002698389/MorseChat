# MorseChat
An iOS app to communicate via Morse Code with local peers over WiFi / Bluetooth.

Simply select a channel and start tapping in Morse to send it to those around you!

- Chat to multiple peers simultaniously

Morse Chat makes heavy use of Apple's Multipeer Connectivity framework to send Morse Code to any dynamically discovered local peers.
The application sets ups local connections via WiFi or Bluetooth with zero configuration and gives a simple connection status via a status bar.

This application utilises the following excellent 3rd party frameworks:
- ITProgressBar by Ilija Tovilo
- Appirater by Robert Haining
- Flurry

#Disclaimer
This awesome application was (up until the end of 2014) sitting on the Apple AppStore making no money... infact it was costing me money! 
As the only party making money from my AppStore account was Apple; I decided to close my account and give out the sourcecode in the hope it'll help someone else.
